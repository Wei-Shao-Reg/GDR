InputImage = {image path + image filename}, t = {time point}

InputMask = {image path + lung mask filename}, t = {time point}

ArtifactMask = {image path + artifact mask filename}, t = {time point}

scale_LBFGS: initial step size used by LBFGS at each resolution

similarityCostType: “SSTVD” for GDR regression, “SSD” for GIR regression.

outputDispStartTime: the starting time point from which to compute the flow of diffeomorphisms using the resulting time-varying velocity field. For example, if outputDispStartTime=0, then the flow of diffeomorphisms starts from the first input image, if outputDispStartTime=1, then the flow of diffeomorphisms starts from the second input image.

outputDispTimes:  a list of time points at which to output the resulting displacement fields, for example, if outputDispStartTime=1 and outputDispTimes = 5, then the GDR code will output the displacement field from the second input image to the sixth input image. 

fixedTemplate:  “False”  if  estimate  a  new  template  image  at  each  iteration, “True” if use the first CT image as the fixed template image.

numberOfResolutions:  number of resolutions.

imageWeights: gamma used in each resolution, the weight put on the similarity cost equals 1/(gamma*gamma).

imageSmoothingFactors:  sizes of the kernels used to smooth the CT images before regression at each resolution.

downsampleFactors:  image downsample factor at each resolution.

deformationKernelSizes:  size of the deformation smoothing kernel at each resolution in mm.

stepSizes:  step size used in gradient descent at each resolution.

numberOfIterations:  maximum number of iterations at each resolution. 

epsilons:  stop criterion used in each resolution. If the rate of loss reduction is smaller than the specified epsilon, the GDR code will stop.

outputDispType:  the type of output displacement field, “Eulerian” for pull-back transformations, and “Lagrangian” for push-forward transformations.

outputDirectory:  path for the outputting regression results.
